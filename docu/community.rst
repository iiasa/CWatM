Community Model
===============


.. csv-table:: 
   :header: "Feature", "Description"
   :widths: 40, 50 

   "Community driven","Open-source but lead by IIASA `GitHub repository <https://github.com/CWatM>`_"
   "Well documented","Documentation, automatic source code documentation `GitHub Docu <https://cwatm.github.io>`_"
   "Easy handling","Use of a setting file with all necessary information for the user  :ref:`rst_setting` and  :ref:`rst_meta`"
   "Multi-platform","Windows, Mac, Linux, Unix - to be used on different platforms (PC, clusters, super-computers)"
   "Modular","Processes in subprograms, easy to adapt to the requirements of options/ solutions `Modular structure <https://github.com/CWatM/CWatM/tree/branch2/source/hydrological_modules>`_"


Water Model
=============


.. csv-table::
   :header: "Feature", "Description"
   :widths: 40, 50 

   "Flexible","different resolution, different processes for different needs, links to other models, across sectors and across scales"
   "Adjustable","to be tailored to the needs at IIASA i.e. collaboration with other programs/models, including solutions and option as part of the model"
   "Multi-disciplinary","including economics, environmental needs, social science perspectives"
   "Sensitive","Sensitive to option / solution"
   "Fast","Global to regional modeling – a mixture between conceptional and physical modeling – as complex as necessary but not more"
   "Comparable","Part of the ISI-MIP community"
