class sealed_water(object):
    """
    Sealed surface and open water runoff and evaporation module.
    
    Handles runoff generation and evaporation processes for impermeable surfaces
    (sealed/urban areas) and open water land cover types. Accounts for water bodies
    not explicitly represented in the lakes/reservoirs/channels framework.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    var : object
        Reference to model variables object containing state variables
    model : object
        Reference to the main CWatM model instance
        
    Notes
    -----
    The module addresses hydrological processes on:
    - Sealed surfaces: Impermeable urban/built-up areas with limited evaporation
    - Open water: Water land cover including small rivers, ponds, wetlands
    
    Open water evaporation accounts for water bodies not captured by explicit
    lakes, reservoirs, and channels. For instance, if explicit water bodies
    cover 10% of a cell but water land class covers 20%, this module handles
    evaporation from the additional 10% of unrepresented water surfaces.
    
    Evaporation rates differ by surface type:
    - Water surfaces: Full reference evapotranspiration rate
    - Sealed surfaces: Reduced rate (0.2 Ãƒâ€” reference) for ponded water

        Calculate runoff and evaporation for sealed surfaces and open water.
        
        Processes water balance for impermeable surfaces and open water land
        cover types, determining direct runoff and evaporation rates based on
        surface characteristics and available water.

        Processing logic:
        - Sealed surfaces (No=4): Limited evaporation (0.2 Ãƒâ€” EWRef), remainder to runoff
        - Open water (No=5): Full evaporation rate (1.0 Ãƒâ€” EWRef), remainder to runoff
        - ModFlow integration: Includes capillary rise contributions to runoff
        - Updates actual evapotranspiration and direct runoff arrays
        
        The method only processes land cover types with No > 3 (sealed and water),
        as other land covers are handled by different modules.
