class CWATModel(CWATModel_ini, CWATModel_dyn):
    """
    Main CWatM model class combining initialization and dynamics.

    This class serves as the primary interface for the Community Water Model (CWatM),
    inheriting from both the initialization (CWATModel_ini) and dynamic (CWATModel_dyn)
    components to provide a complete hydrological modeling framework.

    The model handles:
    
    - Initial setup and parameter configuration
    - Temporal simulation loops
    - Integration of all hydrological processes
    - Model state management

    Attributes
    ----------
    
    Inherits all attributes from CWATModel_ini and CWATModel_dyn including:
    
    - var : object: Model variables container
    - model : object: Model configuration and state

    Notes
    -----
    
    The initial part handles all non-temporal initialization procedures including
    reading input data, setting up model parameters, and initializing state variables.
    The dynamic part manages the temporal simulation loop, executing hydrological
    processes for each time step.
